Superglue: automatically synchronize DNS delegations
====================================================

Superglue ensures your domain's delegation is correct.

Using a registry or registrar API, it updates the delegation in your
parent zone so that it is consistent with the contents of your child
zone.

The name comes from superordinate + glue, though of course superglue
updates NS and DS records and whois contact details as well.

Superglue has a separate program for talking to each API. All the
programs work in a consistent manner. Currently superglue includes
clients for:

	JANET (forward and reverse DNS)
	Mythic Beasts (forward)
	RIPE (reverse DNS)

Superglue does not handle domain registration, renewals, or transfers.


Installation
------------

You can run superglue from a git checkout. (There is not yet a way to
install superglue in a standard location.)

Superglue works with ReGPG for soring encrypted API credentials.

Extra perl dependencies:

  * Data::Compare
  * File::Slurp
  * IPC::System::Simple
  * JSON
  * Moo
  * Net::DNS
  * Net::DNS::SEC
  * Test::Exception
  * Test::TempDir::Tiny
  * URI
  * YAML
  * libwww-perl

For WebDriver-based scripts (JANET and Mythic Beasts), you also need
Firefox and geckodriver.
