Superglue: automatically synchronize DNS delegations
====================================================

Superglue ensures your domain's delegation is correct.

Using a registry or registrar API, it updates the delegation in your
parent zone so that it is consistent with the contents of your child
zone.

The name comes from superordinate + glue, though of course superglue
updates NS and DS records as well.

Superglue has a separate program for talking to each API. All the
programs work in a consistent manner. Currently superglue includes
clients for:

	Gandi
	JANET (forward and reverse DNS)
	RIPE (reverse DNS)

Superglue just deals with DNS delegations. It does not handle other
aspects of domain registration, such as renewals or updating contact
details.


Installation
------------

You can run superglue from a git checkout. (There is not yet a way to
install superglue in a standard location.)

Run `make` to do the build and setup tasks. This downloads a few Perl
modules and a copy of CasperJS.

For superglue-janet you will also need PhantomJS 1.9. The version that
comes with Ubuntu 14.04 is suitable.


Input format
------------

Every superglue program reads delegation records in a subset of
standard RFC 1035 master file format. TTLs are ignored; `$` directives,
`\` escapes, "strings", and `()` continuations are not supported.

The input can contain NS records, DNSKEY records, or both. The owner
name of these records must match the zone. The default owner and
`$ORIGIN` are set to the zone name so you can abbreviate the input
using omitted or unqualified domain names in the standard way.

If the NS RRset or DNSKEY RRset are missing, that part of the
delegation is left alone, so it isn't possible to use superglue to
delete a delegation or make a zone insecure.

If the NS record targets include hostnames at or below the zone name
then glue A and/or AAAA records are required.


Login credentials
-----------------

Every superglue program gets its login credentials from a file in a
standard format.

Blank lines or comment lines starting with a `#` are ignored.
Other lines have the form `<keyword><space><value>`.

Different superglue programs use different keywords depending on the
requirements of the API they use. Most of them need `user` and `pass`
credentials.


deleget
-------

The `deleget` utility queries a child zone to produce delegation records
that can be passed to `superglue` to update the delegation in the parent
zone. This is useful if your DNS provisioning system can't emit the
delegation records itself.


superglue
---------

The umbrella `superglue` program works out how a domain was registered
and therefore which sub-program should be used to update its delegation.
(Not yet written.)


superglue-gandi
---------------

Gandi has an XML-RPC API for controlling all their services.


superglue-janet
---------------

JANET do not provide an API for updating domain delegations, only a
JavaScript-heavy web site <https://naming.ja.net/dns/>. The
`superglue-janet` program uses PhantomJS and CasperJS to drive the web
site using mainly its HTML id=... attributes. We hope these will be
reasonably stable!


superglue-ripe
---------------

You can update the RIPE database by sending whois objects via email,
by "syncupdates" https POST, or using their REST API in XML or JSON
style. This uses the RIPE REST JSON API.

The syncupdates interface is nice and simple, but there isn't a
corresponding authenticated query API - RIPE whois only offers
insecure connections. The REST APIs both have an ugly way of
representing object attributes, like name=nserver value=ns.example.com
instead of nserver=ns.example.com. But apart from that they are OK.
